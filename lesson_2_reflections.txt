How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    first one was working. 2nd one was not. one of the difference has to have the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    easily go back to a working version if you mess up.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    google docs it is easier... but the computer doesn't know when to save... it saves all the time and sometimes overwrites the back up.
manually committing yields more logical and meaningful versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git are for codes. and some codes are related or linked to each other so they would all need to be saved in each commit. google docs was not designed for this purpose.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log allows you to see the history... with the comments to add context... git diff allows you to track the specific changes that happened...

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it is easy to go back to a previous commit. with checkout. so there is really no risk.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git from now on for all of my coding projects and writing projects

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    repositories are special folders. you need to initialize a repository so that it has a structure that tells Git to monitor the files inside
